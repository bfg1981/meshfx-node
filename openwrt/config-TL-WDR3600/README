Setup for openwrt on TP-Link WDR3600 as a dugnadsnett.no mesh node
==================================================================

This recipe is partly based on
<URL: http://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki/Batman-adv-openwrt-config >
and using the trunk version from 2013-11-24 (BARRIER BREAKER, Bleeding
Edge, r38896).
The image used was
<URL: http://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/trunk/ar71xx/openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-wdr3600-v1-squashfs-sysupgrade.bin >.

 1) First, install openwrt on the machine using the recipe available from 
    <URL: http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/tp-link/tl-wdr3600 >

 2) Then, install the kmod-batman-adv package using "opkg install
    kmod-batman-adv".

 3) Next, copy the provided files network, wireless and batman-adv
    into /etc/config/ in the openwrt installation.

 4) Last, modify the IP address 10.9.8.7 to some unique number.  IPv6
    is not yet working with this setup.

Reboot openwrt to get a working mesh node.
